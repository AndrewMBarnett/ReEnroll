- Device ReEnroll With Notification

The extension attribute ( Device ReEnroll Notification Status ) can show if the script ran Profiles Renew command on the computer. This would be useful if you wanted the script to run silently but know if the Profiles Renew dialog window ran or not. The Profiles Renew dialog requires end user interaction to continue, unless they let the timer expire.
